## Monthly Tax Department collections data

The Tax Department reports monthly collections for each state tax on two state websites that do not appear to be integrated (that is, they need not be consistent with each other):

-   Spreadsheets: A single spreadsheet for each month, with all taxes, is [here](https://www.tax.ny.gov/research/collections/monthly_tax_collections.htm). These spreadsheets provide a bit more detail (e.g., they have gross collections, refunds, and net; and they have monthly and fiscal year to date collections). They do not appear to have internal consistency controls (e.g., YTD collections may not equal the sum of monthly collections across separate spreadsheets).

-   OpenData single data file: Monthly Tax Department collections data for most state taxes are [here](https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/New-York-State-Local-and-Local-Purpose-Taxes-and-F/2vni-8tmb) on the OpenData site. This is far more convenient to work with than spreadsheet data.

As discussed below, there are errors in both data sets - some of the errors are the same in each data set and some are unique to one data set or the other.

I suspect that they must keep one master correct data set internally that is not published; as time permits I will inquire and verify.

### OpenData data

#### About the data

-   The site contains links to several documentation files. Here are a few relevant excerpts:

> The Department of Taxation and Finance monthly produces a compilation of those state and local and local purpose taxes and fees collected by the Department. The taxes and fees information provided in this data set are primarily taxes imposed by the Tax Law, but also includes fees that are imposed by other state laws but are administered and collected by the Department. Collections are net of refunds and other processing and accounting adjustments. The data set provides a history of these collections by month beginning with April 1996.
>
> Taxes and fees collections reflected in this data set are compiled from net collections reported monthly by the Accounting Bureau of the Office of Processing and Taxpayer Services, New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.
>
> The collections information reflected in this data set is prior to disposition to specific dedicated revenue funds where required by statute and are comparable to the "all government funds" or "all funds" categorization of revenues by the New York State Division of Budget and the New York State Office of the State Comptroller. However, timing differences on the part of the Accounting Bureau and the Comptroller may give rise to small variations for some of the taxes and fees amounts presented in this dataset.

-   A changelog on the site available for Feb 2023 forward shows when they change data and how many rows they inserted. Based on this:

    -   The data appear to be updated in the 3rd week of the month, for collections in the prior month.

    -   The data as it stood after the update can be downloaded from the changelog area of the site.

    -   As of May 26, 2023, all but one of the Feb 2023+ updates appears to be insertion of data for a new month.

    -   The exception is Apr 20, 2023 when they inserted 2 rows, copied below.

    > month_of_collections,tax_type,tax_or_fee,amount_collected_in_thousands
    >
    > October 2022,Local/local purpose taxes,MCTD Mobility Tax,120513
    >
    > November 2022,Local/local purpose taxes,MCTD Mobility Tax,138102

-   Thus, they appear to have corrected 2 rows in the entire database (which includes all state taxes) for the payroll mobility tax. This is consistent with my Apr 19 email conversation with Aysegul Kocer, which included information from her correspondence with the Tax Department:

-   Note, however, that they do not appear to have updated the total MCTD (which is the sum of the wage tax and the net earnings from self-employment tax) - I'll have to check that.
-   The contact email is [here](OTPA.OpenNYData@tax.ny.gov). I will reach out to them with some additional corrections.

#### Initial look at the data

-   The data are in thousands of dollars.

-   I'm constructing a corrected data subset that has data relevant to the MTA and to forecasting MTA taxes -- that is, the MTA taxes plus any counterparts that might yield insights into these taxes, such as state income tax withholding.

-   Here is what the documentation says about these taxes. Note that the documentation may not be up to date with 2023 law changes, but the data should be.
